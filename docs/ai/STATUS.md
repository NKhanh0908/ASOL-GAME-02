## Open decisions / blockers

- F2: Tasks 1–7 complete. Proceeding to Phase 3 (Tasks 8–10). Reviewer Stop Point 4 is after Task 10.
- G: plans await review at G stop point 1 (9 spec departures listed in the index). G0 can start now; G1/G2 wait for F2.

## Gotchas learned recently

- `BackgroundScene` uses `{ active: true }` and `applyDesignViewport(this)` so the persistent star backdrop stays at the bottom and scales to screen buffer correctly.
- All scene transitions must route through `SceneDirector` (`director.go`, `director.boot`); direct `scene.start(` is blocked by `tests/sceneStartGate.test.ts`.
- `BoardRenderer` stele is divided into base, grid, and top centered at `(360, 600)` with cardinal runes drawn on top of the grid and beneath the glass frame so they remain visible.
- Camera zoom makes `pointer.x/y` diverge from design coordinates. Anything hit-testing against layout must read `pointer.worldX/worldY`.
- `build:release` fails by design until all 28 levels are approved (currently 22; Chapter 4 has six planned levels).
