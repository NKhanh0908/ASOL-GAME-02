 * gold ring, measured across its chord. `diamond` suits a frame whose limit is
 * `|x| + |y| <= budget`, which is what a map node actually is. Fitting a
 * diamond with a box wastes most of it: a fixed box cannot adapt to the
 * figure's own proportions, so a tall level ended up 17px wide inside a 96px
 * node. The diamond fit scales each level until its furthest point lands on
